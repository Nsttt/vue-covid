Little page I made on my free time for tracking covid cases, it's quite simple and I mainly created it to get myself more comfortable working with Vue and checking the v3.0 improvements.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below:

### ‚è≥ Installation

First install all packages necesary.

- You can use `npm` if you like, but I highly recommend you stick with `yarn`.

```bash
yarn install
```

Afterwards the project would be ready for serving on development mode. To do so, just paste the following command.

```bash
yarn dev
```

To build, just use the following one, it will output a folder named `dist`.
****
```bash
yarn build
```
